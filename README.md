## Usage
1. `git clone https://github.com/O-MAREI/forest_fire_simulation.git`
2. `cd [target-directory]`
3. Execute main.py:
    * `python main.py`
2. Use the menu bar to select File -> Open. This will open in the folder `./ca_descriptions`.
3. Open one of the example files;
  - `wolframs_1d.py` is Wolfram's elementary 1D automata
  - `gol_2d.py` is Conway's 2D game of life
  - `forest_fire.py` is a Forest Fire Simulation based on Cellular Automata
4. The main GUI elements will now load, feel free to customise the CA parameters on the left hand panel for Conway and Wolfram
5. For the Forest Fire Simulation, you can adjust the paramaters in ca_descriptions/forest_fire.py, with instructions
5. Run the CA with your parameters
6. The progress bar will appear as the CA is run
7. After the CA has been run, use the playback controls at the top and the slider at the bottom to run through the simulation.
8. You may save an image of the currently displayed output using the 'Take screenshot' button
